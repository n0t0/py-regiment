word = 'banana'
count = 0
for letter in word:
    if letter == 'a':
        count = count + 1
print count


# Exercise 5
# Encapsulate this code in a function named count, and generalize
# it so that it accepts the string and the letter as arguments.
# Exercise 6
# Rewrite this function so that instead of traversing the string,
# it uses the three-parameter version of find from the previous section.
