# If you run a 10 kilometer race in 43 minutes 30 seconds,
# what is your average time per mile? What is your average
# speed in miles per hour? (Hint: there are 1.61 kilometers in a mile).

# Speed = Distance / Time

# Convert 10 Kg into miles

print 10 / 1.61

# Convert 43 minutes and 30 seconds to get decimal of a hour

print 43.5 / 60

# Calculate Average Speed

print 6.21 / 0.72
