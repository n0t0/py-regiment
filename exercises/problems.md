# Exercise 6
A _palindrome_ is a word that is spelled the same backward and forward, like "civic" and "racecar". Recursively, a word is a palindrome if the first and last letters are the same and the middle is a palindrome.

The following are functions that take a string argument and return the first, last, and middle letters:

_def first(word):
    return word[0]

def last(word):
    return word[-1]

def middle(word):
    return word[1:-1]_


Type these functions into a file named palindrome.py and test them out. What happens if you call middle with a string with two letters? One letter? What about the empty string, which is written '' and contains no letters?
Write a function called is_palindrome that takes a string argument and returns True if it is a palindrome and False otherwise. Remember that you can use the built-in function len to check the length of a string.


# Exercise 7  
A number, a, is a power of b if it is divisible by b and a/b is a power of b. Write a function called is_power that takes parameters a and b and returns True if a is a power of b. Note: you will have to think about the base case.

# Exercise 8  
The greatest common divisor (GCD) of a and b is the largest number that divides both of them with no remainder.

One way to find the GCD of two numbers is based on the observation that if r is the remainder when a is divided by b, then gcd(a, b) = gcd(b, r). As a base case, we can use gcd(a, 0) = a.

Write a function called gcd that takes parameters a and b and returns their greatest common divisor.

# Exercise 9
The built-in function eval takes a string and evaluates it using the Python interpreter. For example:

>>> eval('1 + 2 * 3')
7
>>> import math
>>> eval('math.sqrt(5)')
2.2360679774997898
>>> eval('type(math.pi)')
<type 'float'>
Write a function called eval_loop that iteratively prompts the user, takes the resulting input and evaluates it using eval, and prints the result.

It should continue until the user enters 'done', and then return the value of the last expression it evaluated.
