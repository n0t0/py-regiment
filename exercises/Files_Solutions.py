# Write a function called sed that takes as arguments a pattern string,
# a replacement string, and two filenames; it should read the first file
# and write the contents into the second file (creating it if necessary).
# If the pattern string appears anywhere in the file, it should be replaced
# with the replacement string.

# If an error occurs while opening, reading, writing or closing files,
# your program should catch the exception, print an error message, and exit.
