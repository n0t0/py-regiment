### Exercise 1
Write a function called _distance_between_points_ that takes two _Points_
as arguments and returns the distance between them.

### Exercise 2
Write a function named _move_rectangle_ that takes a _Rectangle_ and two numbers
named dx and dy. It should change the location of the rectangle by adding dx
to the x coordinate of corner and adding dy to the y coordinate of corner.

### Exercise 3  
Write a version of _move_rectangle_ that creates and returns a new _Rectangle_ instead of modifying the old one.
